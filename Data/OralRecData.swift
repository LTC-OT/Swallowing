" If a sign of aspiration is present in addition to mild anterior spillage, consider to change consistency of fluids or texture of food to ensure an adequate bolus formation , manipulation and transit, otherwise no radical changes in resident's diet are necessary",
    
" If severe spillage with fluids present: Thickened fluids, severe spillage with food: Change food texture to cohesive texture to facilitate bolus formation, manipulation, transist and decrease risks of aspiration",
    
" If significant residues in oral cavity are present,  in addition to mild decreased rotatory movements, change texture of food to facilitate grind down activity and ease bolus formation, otherwise recommend  small mouthful as  strategy",
    
" If  severe decreased rotatory movements, change texture food to facilitate grind down activity, assess amount of residues in oral cavity, likely would be significant residues. Changing texture would facilitate the bolus formation, management and transit in order to ease swallow and decrease risks of aspirartion or choking",
    
" If significant residues in oral cavity are present in addition to mild prologed chewing time, downgrade texture food to ease chewing activity  decrease potential  tiredness or fatigue and decrease risks of aspiration or choking ",
    
" With severe prolonged chewing time present, resident is a high risk of aspiration or choking, poor intake or pocketing, changing food texture is recommended to facilitate adequate grind down food, ensure food is softer and moist in order to facilitate the bolus formation, managing and transit",
    
"  Recommend encourage resident to have another swallow to clear oral cavity, If there is evidence of prolonged chewing time or fatigue in addition to mild residues in oral cavity after swallow, change texture of food to a more cohesive and moist texture food items to facilitate bolus formation, manipulation and transit, in order to decrease risks of choking or aspiration",
    
" With significant amount of residues in oral cavity after swallow, indicates that resident is presenting  deficits in the ability to formate bolus,  to manipulate it , a change in food texture is recommended to decrease risks of choking or aspiration",
    
" If occasionally coughing with food is present in addition to another sign of aspiration or a sign of oral motor deficits, change food texture , otherwise no changes are necessary, continue monitoring resident for further incidents of coughing",
    
" If frequently coughing with food, determine if coughing is present with a specific food item, consider to restric this item before changing diet texture, if coughing is not present after removing food item, no changes are necessary, otherwise downgrade diet texture  for safety",

" If inmediately coughing with food is present, downgrade diet texture to a safer level",
    
" If occasionally coughing with fluids is present in addition to another sign of aspiration, change consistency of fluids to a safer level, otherwise make no changes in order to maintain adequate levels of hydration",
    
" If frequently and inmediately coughing with fluids is present, change consistency of fluids to safe level to decrease risks of aspiration",

" If occasionally coughing with mixed texture is present in addition to another sign of aspiration, change diet to dysphagia in order to restric mixed texture food items in current diet menu, otherwise no make changes and continue monitoring for further coughing with mixed texture incidents",
    
" If frequently and inmediately  coughing with mixed texture is present, change diet to dysphagia to restric mixed texture food items in current diet menu",
    
" If full dentition is in situ, ensure fit well, enquiere for pain, soreness or discomfort when chewing",
    
" If upper or lower partial denture in situ ensure fit well, enquiere for pain, soreness or discomfort when chewing  ",
    
" If upper or lower partial denture, ensure fit well, enquire for pain, soreness or discomfort when chewing",
    
" If no teeth or dentures in situ, or resident declines to wear them, downgrade food texture, evaluate if resident is able to manage minced texture otherwise downgrade to pureed texture for safety in order to prevent choking or aspiration ",
    
" If lip seal is inadequate and resident presents with significant anterior spillage , change texture of food and/or consistency of fluids to facilitate bolus formation and decrease spillage",
    
" If mouth aperture is significant reduced and poor intake is present, change food texture to pureed or minced to facilitate oral intake",

" If delay swallow is present in addition to a sign of aspiration, recommend to change current diet",

" If hyoide elevation is incomplete, in addition to a sign of aspiration, recommend to change current diet, otherwise, no changes are necessary",
    
" If effortful swallow is significantly present , changes in food texture is recommneded in order to ease swallowing and decrease pain or discomfort, otherwise, recommed add extra sauce and gravy  to increase moist in current diet texture"
